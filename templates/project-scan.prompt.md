Analyze this codebase and create a comprehensive summary for developers who need to implement features. Write your findings to a file called MILLHOUSE_PROJECT.md in the repository root.

The summary should include:

## Project Overview
- What this project does (1-2 paragraphs)
- Key technologies and frameworks used

## Directory Structure
- Purpose of each top-level directory
- Where different types of code live (components, utils, tests, etc.)

## Architecture
- High-level architecture and data flow
- Key modules and how they interact
- Important patterns used (e.g., MVC, event-driven, etc.)

## Key Files
- Entry points (main files, index files)
- Configuration files and what they control
- Important utility modules

## Conventions
- Naming conventions observed
- Code organization patterns
- Testing approach

## Build & Development
- How to build/run the project
- Key scripts in package.json (or equivalent)
- Environment setup requirements

Keep the summary concise but comprehensive - aim for 200-400 lines. Focus on information that helps someone implement new features correctly.
